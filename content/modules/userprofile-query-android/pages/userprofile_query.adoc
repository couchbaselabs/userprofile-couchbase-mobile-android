== Introduction


Couchbase Lite brings powerful querying and Full-Text-Search(FTS) capabilities to the edge.

Its query interface is based on
https://www.couchbase.com/products/n1ql[N1QL],
Couchbaseâ€™s declarative query language, which implements the emerging SQL++ standard.

The query API is designed using the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface[Fluent API Design Pattern],
and uses method cascading to read like a Domain Specific Language (DSL).
This makes the interface very intuitive and easy to understand.

Couchbase Lite can be used as a standalone embedded database within your mobile app.

.What You Will Learn
****
This tutorial will walk through a simple Android app that will:

* Demonstrate how you can bundle, load and use a *_prebuilt_* instance of Couchbase Lite
* Introduce you to the basics of the `QueryBuilder` interface

== Prerequisites


This tutorial assumes familiarity with building
https://www.android.com/[Android]
apps using
https://www.java.com[Java]
and with the basics of Couchbase Lite.

* If you are unfamiliar with the basics of Couchbase Lite, it is recommended that you walk through the
{standalone--xref}, covering the fundamentals of using Couchbase Lite as a standalone database

* https://developer.android.com/studio[Android Studio]

* Android device or emulator running API level 22 or above

* Android SDK 29+

* Android Build Tools 29+

* https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[JDK 8]

* git (Optional)
This is required if you would prefer to pull the source code from GitHub repo.

** Create a
https://github.com[free github account]
if you don't already have one

** git can be downloaded from
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[git-scm.org]


== App Overview


We will be working with a very simple "User Profile" app.
If you have walked through the {standalone--xref}, you will quickly realize that this version extends the functionality introduced in that tutorial.

This app does the following:

* Allows users to log in and create or update his/her user profile information, which was also possible in the {standalone--xref}

* As part of profile information, users can now select a `University` from a list of possible options. +
This list of universities is queried (using the new Query API) from a local _prebuilt_ "University" Couchbase Lite database that is bundled in the app.

* When saved, the user profile information is persisted as a `Document` in a local Couchbase Lite database.
So, when the user logs back in again, the profile information is loaded from the `Database`.

== Installation


Clone the *_query_* branch of the `User Profile Demo` solution from GitHub.
Assuming that you have installed
https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git]
you can use the following command to do this:

[source,bash]
----
git clone -b query https://github.com/couchbaselabs/userprofile-couchbase-mobile-android.git
----

=== Installing Couchbase Lite

This
{githubsrc}[sample project]
already contains the appropriate additions for downloading, and utilizing the Android Couchbase Lite dependency module.
However, in the future, to include Couchbase Lite support within an Android app add the the following within
{githubsrc}/app/build.gradle[app/build.gradle].

[source,gradle]
----
  dependencies {
    ...

    implementation 'com.couchbase.lite:couchbase-lite-android-ee:3.0.0'
}
----

.Try it out
****
. Open
{githubsrc}/build.gradle[build.gradle]
using Android Studio.
. Build and run the project.
. Verify that you see the login screen.
+

== Sample App Architecture


The sample app follows the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter[MVP pattern],
separating the internal data model, from a passive view through a presenter that handles the logic of our application and acts as the conduit between the model and the view.

image::mvp_architecture.png[MVP Architecture]

In the Android Studio project, the code is structured by feature.
You can select the Android option in the left navigator to view the files by package.

image::mvp_as.png[MVP Android Studio]

Each package comprises the following:

* **Activity**: This is where all the view logic resides.

* **Presenter**: This is where all the business logic resides to fetch and persist data to a web service or the embedded Couchbase Lite database.

* **Contract**: An interface that the `Presenter` and `Activity` implement.

image::mvp_package.png[MVP Package]


== Data Model


Couchbase Lite is a JSON Document Store.
A Document is a logical collection of named fields and values.
The values are any valid JSON types.
In addition to the standard JSON types, Couchbase Lite supports some special types like `Date` and `Blob`.
While it is not required or enforced, it is a recommended practice to include a _"type"_ property that can serve as a namespace for related.

=== The User Profile Document

The app deals with a single `Document` with a _"type"_ property of _"user"_.
The document ID is of the form _"user::<email>"_.

An example of a document would be

[source, json]
----
{
    "type":"user",
    "name":"Jane Doe",
    "email":"jame.doe@earth.org",
    "address":"101 Main Street",
    "image":CBLBlob (image/jpg),
    "university":"Missouri State University"
}
----

[#user-profile]
=== UserProfile

For the purpose of this tutorial the _"user"_ `Document` is first stored within an `Object` of type `Map<String, Object>`.

[source,java, sibs="attributes+, macros+"]
----
include::example$/src/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/userprofile/profile/UserProfileActivity.java[tags=userprofile,indent=0]
----

The `Map<String, Object>` object functions used as a data storage mechanism between the app's UI and the backing functionality of the Couchbase Lite `Document` object.

[#university-document]
=== The University Document

The app comes bundled with a collection of Documents of type _"university"_. Each `Document` represents a university.


```json
{
    "type":"university","web_pages": [
      "http://www.missouristate.edu/"
    ],
    "name": "Missouri State University",
    "alpha_two_code": "US",
    "state-province": MO,
    "domains": [
      "missouristate.edu"
    ],
    "country": "United States"
}
```

=== The University Record

When _"university"_ `Document` is retrieved from the database it is stored within an `Object` of type `Map<String, Object>`.

[source,java]
----
include::example$/src/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/userprofile/universities/UniversitiesPresenter.java[tags=university,indent=0]
----


== Using a Prebuilt Database

There are several reasons why you may want to bundle your app with a prebuilt database.
This would be suited for data that does not change or change that often, so you can avoid the bandwidth and latency involved in fetching/syncing this data from a remote server.
This also improves the overall user experience by reducing the start-up time.

In our app, the instance of Couchbase Lite that holds the pre-loaded _"university"_ data is separate from the Couchbase Lite instance that holds _"user"_ data hold the pre-loaded data.
A separate Couchbase Lite instance is not required.
However, in our case, since there can be many users potentially using the app on a given device, it makes more sense to keep it separate.
This is to avoid duplication of pre-loaded data for every user.

=== Location of the cblite file
The pre-built database is in the form of a `cblite` file.
It will be be in your app project bundle

* In the `universities.zip` file within the `Assets` folder.
+
image::cblite_location.png[Prebuilt Database Location]
+
Note: The cblite folder will be extracted from the zip file.

[#prebuilt-database]
=== Loading the Prebuilt Database

* Open the
{githubsrc}/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/userprofile/util/DatabaseManager.java[*DatabaseManager.java*]
file and locate the `openPrebuiltDatabase()` function.
The prebuilt database is common to all users of the app (on the device).
So it will be loaded once and shared by all users on the device.
+
[source,java]
----
include::example$/src/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/userprofile/util/DatabaseManager.java[tags=openPrebuiltDatabase,indent=0]
----

* First, we create an instance of `DatabaseConfiguration` object and specify the path where the database would be located
+
[source,java]
----
include::example$/src/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/userprofile/util/DatabaseManager.java[tags=prebuiltdbconfig,indent=0]
----

* Then we determine if the "universities" database already exists at the specified location.
It would not be present if this is the first time we are using the app, in which case, we locate the _"universities.cblite"_ resource in the App's main bundle and we copy it over to the Database folder.
+
If the database is already present at the specified Database location, we simply open the database.
+
[source,java]
----
include::example$/src/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/userprofile/util/DatabaseManager.java[tags=prebuiltdbopen,indent=0]
----

=== Indexing the Prebuilt Database

* Creating indexes for non-FTS based queries is optional.
However, in order to speed up queries, you can create indexes on the properties that you would query against.
Indexing is handled eagerly.

* In the {githubsrc}/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/userprofile/util/DatabaseManager.java[*DatabaseManager.java*] file, locate the `createUniversityDatabaseIndexes()` function.
We create an index on the `name` and `location` properties of the documents in the _university_ database.
+
[source,java]
----
include::example$/src/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/userprofile/util/DatabaseManager.java[tags=createUniversityDatabaseIndexes,indent=0]
----

=== Closing the Database

When a user logs out, we close the Prebuilt Database along with other user-specific databases

* In the {githubsrc}/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/userprofile/util/DatabaseManager.java[*DatabaseManager.java*] file, locate the `closePrebuiltDatabase()` function.
+
[source,java]
----
include::example$/src/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/userprofile/util/DatabaseManager.java[tags=closePrebuiltDatabase,indent=0]
----

* Closing the database is pretty straightforward
+
[source,java]
----
include::example$/src/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/userprofile/util/DatabaseManager.java[tags=prebuiltdbclose,indent=0]
----

.Try It Out
****
. The app should be running in the simulator
. Log into the app with any email Id and password.
Let's use the values _"demo@example.com"_ and _"password"_ for user Id and password fields respectively.
If this is the first time that _any_ user is signing in to the app, the pre-built database will be loaded from the App Bundle.
In addition, new user-specific Database will be created / opened.
. Confirm that the console log output has a message similar to the one below.
In my example, I am logging in with a user email Id of _"demo@example.com"_.
+
[source,bash]
----
2019-06-12 13:07:12.542 24206-24206/com.couchbase.userprofile I/CB-Update: Will open Prebuilt DB  at path /data/user/0/com.couchbase.userprofile/files
----
. The above log message indicate the location of the Prebuilt database as well as the Database for the user. This would be within the _files_ folder.
****


== Exploring the Query API


The Query API in Couchbase Lite is extensive.
In our app, we will be using the `QueryBuilder` API to make a simple _pattern matching_ query using the `like` operator.

=== Fetching University Document

From the "Your Profile" screen, when the user taps on the "University" cell, a search screen is displayed where the user can enter the search criteria (name and optionally, the location) for the university.
When the search criteria is entered, the local _"universities"_ Database is queried for the <<university-document, University>> documents that match the specified search criteria.

* Open the {githubsrc}/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/userprofile/universities/UniversitiesPresenter.java[*UniversitiesPresenter.java*] file and locate the `fetchUniversities` function.
+
[source,java]
----
include::example$/src/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/userprofile/universities/UniversitiesPresenter.java[tags=fetchUniversities,indent=0]
----

* We build the Query using the `QueryBuilder` API that will look for Documents that match the specified criteria.
+
[source,java]
----
include::example$/src/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/userprofile/universities/UniversitiesPresenter.java[tags=buildquery,indent=0]
----
+
<1> Build a `QueryExpression` that uses the `like` operator to look for the specified _"name"_ string in the _"name"_ property.
Notice couple of things here: +
(a) The use of *wildcard "%" operator* to denote that we are looking for the presence of the string anywhere in the _"name"_ property +
(b) The use of `Function.lower()` to convert the search string into lowercase equivalent.
This is because the `like` operator does _case-sensitive matching_, so we must convert the search string and the property value to lowercase equivalents and compare the two.
<2> If the location criteria was specified in the search, then Build a `QueryExpression` that uses the `like` operator to look for the specified _"location"_ string in the _"location"_ property.
<3> The `SelectResult.all()` specifiees that we are interested in all properties in Documents that match the specified criteria
<4> The `DataSource.database(db)` specified the Data Source
<5> We include the `where` clause that is the logical ANDing of the QueryExpression in <1> and <2>

* We run the Query by calling the `execute()` method on the Query that was constructed in the previous step
+
[source,java]
----
include::example$/src/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/userprofile/universities/UniversitiesPresenter.java[tags=runquery,indent=0]
----
<1> Create an instance of <<university-document, UniversityRecord>> (via `HashMap`).
<2> Use specific type getters to fetch property values.
The <<university-document, UniversityRecord>> instance is populated with these property values.
<3> Getters also available for `array` types.
This returns a Couchbase Lite `ArrayObject` type.

.Try It Out
